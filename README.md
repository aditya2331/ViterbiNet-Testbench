## Background
The code is inspired by the paper Shlezinger et Al., “ViterbiNet: A deep learning based Viterbi algorithm for symbol detection,” IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., vol. 19, no. 5, pp. 3319–3331, 2020.
## Testbench
We simulate the effects of an ISI channel with AWGN on BPSK symbols, and compare the equalization performance of ViterbiNet against the Viterbi Algorithm by plotting the SER.
